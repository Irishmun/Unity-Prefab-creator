# Unity Prefab Creator

This tool is used to turn objects that are already present in the scene into prefabs, or to create a blank prefab.

## Uses

*But what can you do with it?*

you can:
- Create a blank prefab in the project window
- Create individual prefabs from the selected objects, turning those into instances of the prefabs
- Create a single prefab from the selected objects, turning those into instances of the newly created prefab, whilst keeping their own transform values

These options can be found under "*Prefab Utility*" which is also present in the context menu
